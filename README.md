## Code Guide

Use Black as the code formatter. Functions internal to a class start with an underscore. Use docstrings to comment every class and function. Define additional functions that provide common utility in `utils.py`. Use underscores (`_`) to split all variables and functions (class names must begin with a capital letter). Multi-use imports at the start of file but inline imports preferred.
