# XAI

Explainable Artificial Intelligence for the Capstone Project

## Introduction

This repository holds our basic code from Phase 1 written in Python 3.

[WIP: Please add details in the form of sections as you add your code.]

## Setup

To install required python3 packages use pip. Run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## File Structure

- `data` - Holds data such as datasets, images etc.
- `obj` - Holds pickled files, etc.

- `main.py` - Find usage instructions by running `python3 main.py --help`

[WIP: Please add details in the form of sections as you add your code.]

## Code Guide

Use Black as the code formatter. Functions internal to a class start with an underscore. Use docstrings to comment every class and function. Define additional functions that provide common utility in `utils.py`. Use underscores (`_`) to split all variables and functions (class names must begin with a capital letter). Multi-use imports at the start of file but inline imports preferred.
